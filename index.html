        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Eddie Delgado. A little about myself is that I am currently enrolled at the University of California, Riverside studying to get my Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration either in Finance or Accounting. The high school I attended before going to college is La Quinta High School where I graduated with Magna Cum Laude. Some things I enjoy doing is going out with my friends, exploring new things, cooking, gardening, reading, and more. With things I am passionate about I am still trying to figure out, but some things I can list are helping the environment whether it be the air, cleaning up plastic, or reducing carbon emissions. Some sports I like are football, boxing, basketball, and golfing. I enjoy running and going to the gym. I enjoy listening to pop music and R&B and only smetimes I enjoy to go out and try new things food wise. Things like a cafe, restaurant, and sometimes shopping. I like to travel, a place I have been to recently is Cancun and my favorite vacation was Cabo San Lucas. I like to travel becase I enjoy to see the new scenery and the world where I don't usually get to see everyday. When it comes to traveling, I enjoy relaxing, seeing cultures, the food, and getting to see the different things.<br><br>

        I am responsible and motivated and ready to apply education into work. I feel like I have the ability to handle challenging work, have the energy to stay motivated, get work done efficiently, and able to collaborate with people. I am a hardworking individual with great customer service skills, multitasking, and time management abilities. I am devoted to giving every individual a positive and memorable experience as I am a highly-motivated employee with a desire to take on new challenges. With a strong work ethic, adaptability, and exceptional interpersonal skills I can use these to work effectively in collaboration with other individuals. I want to start working as soon as possible to get a first hand experience and a layout of what I would be expecting for future employment. Furthermore, I am ready to start working promptly and grow from every interaction. 
<br><br>

        Although, I don't have any work experience yet per se, I am working on expanding my experience by challenging to get involved in more things around the campus where I am currently studying from. Maybe some internships, clubs, or jobs I can still apply to can give me the experience of hands on deck of getting to familiar with things. Networking is a good idea to start with and getting to know people would also be a good start. Some challeges I had to overcome was in my last year of high school when I had gotten burned out and slipped a little when it came to grades, but I noticed this and worked very hard to turn this around and get work done by just talking with my teachers and asking for help. With this challenge I had overcome, I am now a better student compared to before this.
